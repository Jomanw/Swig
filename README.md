# Japanese Quickfind (Swig)

I like to listen to japanese music, especially while on my laptop. I'm still trying to learn the language, though, so whenever I hear a word that I don't know, I instantly want to look it up. Even when I'm reading lyrics or an article  in japanese, it always helps to have a quick way to reference the meanings of words in Japanese. However, every time I do this, I have to type in "`japanese word` japanese meaning" into google, and then scroll through the list of resulting web pages that have every incentive to not show you the result instantly, which will lead you to waste time clicking on their website. While I appreciate the fact that these websites exist, I feel like there should be something with a much shorter response time. I think there should be very little time between the moment I get the desire to know the meaning of a word, and the time that I learn the meaning of the word. So, I created a tool to allow me to do just that: Introducing Swig, the seamless interface between you and japanese.

### What it does

Just like how spotlight search gives you instant access to various programs on your machine, Swig enables users to seamlessly retrieve the meanings of words in Japanese. Enter a keyboard shortcut and type in the word that you heard, and then the multiple  definitions with autocomplete will appear as you type. No more wasted time googling around for word translations, no more frustration.

### How to install

#### From website
Head on over to the project page at LINK and follow the installation steps.

#### From source
If installing from Github, simply clone this repo, navigate to the base folder, and enter the command `npm run dev`

#### Feature requests:
I made this so others wouldn't have to go through so much hassle just to find the meanings of words in other languages. However, this is still a work in progress, and I would love to hear thoughts as to how it can improve. If you have anything to share, feel free to reach out at `jordmanwick@gmail.com`.

### Shoutouts
I used the `basic-electron-react-boilerplate` to create this project, which made it super easy to get up and running without having to deal with setup process. You can find the link here: https://github.com/pbarbiero/basic-electron-react-boilerplate


### Roadmap:
Add support for more languages
Add support for searching with different characters
Add configuration page
Add page for saving words to remember, with functionality to save the words
